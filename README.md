## Refection

While continuing the work with json and DOM work we are able to manipulate the DOM with code that will follow time card. These are able to be stored on the local server to keep in the shell. As a starter code will be able to go back and continue with more features to make more interactive and visually appealing.


## Features

Save feature for todo items
Notification the items where saved to the local server. 
Clear button to reset the day.
